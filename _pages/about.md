I am a data scientist with a background in quantitative social science. I earned my PhD in Political Science at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in December, 2017 and am currently a postdoctoral lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania.

I am proficient in Python, R, and SQL. I have experience with a variety of analytical techniques including machine learning regression and classification (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost), natural language processing, causal inference, geospatial analysis, multilevel models, survival analysis, and survey research.

My academic research focuses on armed conflict. The major focus of my work is the cohesion of national militaries. In a manuscript currently under review, I use quantitative measures of repression and political instability to show that militaries often fracture in protest of human rights abuses by the state, with coups and insurgencies founded by defectors from the military being especially likely in the wake of repressive shocks. In a related working paper, I use machine learning techniques to address missing data problems in measures of human rights violations, identifying geographic locations that are likely to have been the site of unreported killings. Additionally, I have written on the role of international law in managing territorial disputes and the economic effects of armed conflict.
