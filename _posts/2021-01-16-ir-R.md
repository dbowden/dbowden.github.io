I have been using R for research on international relations (IR) for about 10 years. One of the greatest strengths of R is its vibrant community of developers, which has contributed a staggering number of packages bringing specialized methods and data manipulation tools to the language. Navigating this vast sea of packages can be difficult, however, particularly given that many have overlapping functionality. In this post I will discuss some of the packages and approaches that I have found to be most useful, with a particular focus on the unique challenges of IR data. This is intended as a note to my future self as much as anything, but hopefully others will find it useful.

## IR-Specific Data Structures

- states
- peacesciencer
- countrycode

## IR Datasets

- WDI
- pwt
- unvotes
- subX
- UCDP?
- WVS?

## Other Data Tools

- fst
- tsibble

## Visualization

- ggplot2
- plotly
- sjPlot

## Analysis

- fixest / bife / survival::clogit
- ggeffect
- coeftest / multiwaycov

## Output

- modelsummary
