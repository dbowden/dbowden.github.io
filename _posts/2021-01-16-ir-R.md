Here are some of the R packages and techniques that I have found to be most useful in International Relations (IR) research. I'm constructing this as a note to my future self as much as anything, but maybe others will find it useful.

## IR Data Structures

- [states](https://github.com/andybega/states) makes it very easy to create empty frames of country-years `state_panel` command. The `sfind` command is also very useful for looking up country codes.
- I haven't used [peacesciencer](https://github.com/svmiller/peacesciencer) package as it is very new, but it appears to improve on `states` with the ability to create not only country-year datasets, but directed and undirected dyad-years. It can also seamlessly merge in several Correlates of War and related datasets. 
- [countrycode](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/countrycode) converts between a large number of country identifier schemes including robust handling of 

I strongly recommend beginning the process of dataset construction with an empty frame of all the geographic units and time periods we wish to include in an analysis. This will help us keep track of missing values and avoid gaps in our temporal coverage that could cause problems if we try to use time series operators like lags. . I haven't used the 

Once you have your frame of cases, you should use 'left joins' that preserve all the rows in the first dataset and keep only rows from the second dataset that match a row in the first. Using the `dplyr` package, one could do something like this: `left_join(original_dataframe, new_dataset, by = c("countryid", "year"))`. Unfortunately there is not a universal standard country ID system. Fortunately, the   package provides for easy conversion between all of the most common identifier systems.
