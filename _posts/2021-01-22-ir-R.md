Here are some of the R packages and techniques that I have found to be most useful in International Relations (IR) research. I'm writing this as a note to my future self as much as anything, but maybe others will find it useful.

## IR Data Structures

- [states](https://github.com/andybega/states) makes it very easy to create empty frames of country-years `state_panel` command. The `sfind` command is also very useful for looking up country codes.
- I haven't used the [peacesciencer](https://github.com/svmiller/peacesciencer) package as it is very new, but it appears to improve on `states` with the ability to create not only country-year datasets, but directed and undirected dyad-years. It can also seamlessly merge in several Correlates of War and related datasets. 
- [countrycode](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/countrycode) converts between a large number of country identifier schemes.
